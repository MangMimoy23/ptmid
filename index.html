     <h3>SINIGANG</h3>

      <p>Sinigang is a classic Filipino soup characterized by its sour and savory medley of flavors. It's popular comfort food in the Philippines,
usually served on its own or paired with steamed rice on rainy days to ward off the cold. Like adobo, the term sinigang describes a cooking method more than a particular dish, as it has many variations. It can be made with protein such as pork, fish, shrimp, beef,and chicken and souring agents such as tamarind, guava, green mango, calamansi, kamias, batuan, santol, and other native fruits. Amix of tender meat, fresh spinach, string beans, and tomatoes, as well as a dash (or more) of savory fish sauce, make for the perfectcombination in simmering and incorporating each unique flavor with each other. Powerful and poignant, sinigang is a Filipino native,
through and through. Its name, sinigang, originates from the Tagalog verb that directly translates to “to stew” — sigang! Because ofits Tagalog name, many presume it to be Tagalog in origin as well. This yummy meal has relatives in other regions in the country aswell, to be sure — yet none are quite like this classic soup that many have fallen in love with. Again, sinigang isn’t a dish so much asit is a cooking method. This is why, like we mentioned earlier, there are a wide number of variations of this delicious dish! Theseinclude your sinigang na hipon, a favorite seafood variant. Here, tender and fresh shrimp soak up all the vibrant flavors of your beloved
stew. It’s important to keep your shrimp perfectly cooked, so it’s much easier to peel the skin off later on.>
